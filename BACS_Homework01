#Read data from file
customers <- read.table(file = "customers.txt", header =TRUE)
ages <- customers$age
length(ages)


#Answer for the Homework 2
##Q1: 5th elements
ages[5]

##Q2: fifth lowest age
sorted_ages <- sort(ages)
sorted_ages[5]

##Q3: five lowest ages together
sorted_ages[1:5]

##Q4: average age
mean_ages <- sum(ages) / length(ages)
mean_ages

##Q5: decreasing order five highest ages
five_lowest_dist <- sort(sorted_ages, decreasing=TRUE)[c(1:5)]
five_lowest_dist

##Q6: standard deviation of ages
sd(ages)

##Q7: age_diff, with the difference between each age and the mean age
age_diff <- ages - mean(ages)
age_diff

##Q8: Average “difference between each age and the mean age”
mean(age_diff)

##Q9: (a) histogram, (b) density plot, (c) boxplot+stripchart
### (a) histogram
hist(ages)
### (b) density plot
plot(density(ages))
### (c) boxplot+stripchart
boxplot(ages)
stripchart(ages,add = TRUE)
